#1
1A) The first value returned by fibonacci(5) is 1.
    fibonacci(5) => fibonacci(3) => fibonacci(1) => 1

1B) The second value returned is 0.
    fibonacci(3) returns fibonacci(1) - fibonacci(2) =>
    1 + fibonacci(0) + fibonacci(1)

1C) The final value returned is 3, not counting the return of fibonacci(5) itself.
    fibonacci(4) is the final function call and returns 3.

1D) There are 14 recursive calls to fibonacci

#2
2A) False
2B) True
2C) The overall test fails.
