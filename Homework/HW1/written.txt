Written #3
In this example, the third print statement doesn't work for two reasons. 
First, the argument, hello, is not wrapped in quotation marks and is therefore
not a string. Since it is not a string, the only valid option is that it is a 
variable. However, the variable hello is not defined anywhere in the script, 
so the interpreter throws an exception.
