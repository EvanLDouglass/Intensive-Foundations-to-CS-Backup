_total: 100/100_

### Program:
##### P1:
- very readable code, nice job formatting the strings instead of rounding them and good work getting user input with a function.

##### P2:
- The program should tell the user how many bikes it could make with each respective part, in addition to the cumulative answer.
```
-> How many wheels do you have?
-> 3
-> I can make 1 bike with that.
-> How many frames do you have?
-> 3
-> I can make 3 bikes with that.
-> How many links do you have?
-> 106
-> I can make 2 bikes with that.
-> Ok, you've got 1 bike coming!
-> I'm keeping the leftovers for myself:
-> 1 wheel, 2 frames, and 450 links
```
